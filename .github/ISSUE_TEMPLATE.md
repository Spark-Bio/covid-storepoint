-----[FOR BUGS]-----

Stakeholders: TBD

## Description

Provide as much background as you need to get the implementer up to speed on the
problem to be solved. This can also include screenshots, excerpts from support
emails, and links to other issues or pull requests.


## Steps to Reproduce

Don't forget to point out the difference between what *should* happen and what
*does* happen. Here's an example:

1. Login as a super admin
2. Go to /admin/reports
3. Click on the "Provider Billing Report" link
4. A 500 error page is displayed instead of a confirmation page.


## Questions

* Is this bug reproducible by engineering?
  * yes or no
* What is the impact?
  * which users are affected? does it happen all the time? how many bills does it affect?

-----[FOR EVERYTHING ELSE]-----

Stakeholders: TBD

## Goal

Explain the **goal** of this issue. Focus on the problem that
needs to be solved, and not on a particular solution. For example: "Make it
easier for users to reset their passwords"


## Description

Provide as much background as you need to get the implementer up to speed on the
problem to be solved. This can also include screenshots, excerpts from support
emails, and links to other issues or pull requests.


## Success Criteria

How would a stakeholder test whether the issue has been completed or not?

You can put "TBD" here if we don't yet know enough about the problem to be
solved. But we should make every effort to define success criteria *before*
starting on a ticket.
