zMax Dragway (Atrium Health),"Atrium has launched a digital COVID-19 risk assessment for patients. Answering a few quick questions will allow Atrium to give patients immediate recommendations on the next step of their care. Testing for COVID-19 is conducted without patients having to get out of their cars, which reduces the possibility of infecting other patients and healthcare workers. Healthcare providers will make appointments and direct patients to designated testing centers where medical professionals will approach the patients at their cars. These tests involve obtaining swabbed samples, which are then tested at Atrium Health’s in-house lab, and patients are typically notified of the results in approximately 24 hours. Atrium Health can test approximately 1,000 samples each day and is one of the only health systems in the nation to have this capability.",6570 Bruton Smith Blvd,Concord,NC,28027,"",(704) 468-8888,https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/real-time-coronavirus-updates-march-24/275-08e835fa-7a0c-4dee-bfb5-b484b704c175,"",call for hours,call for hours,call for hours,call for hours,call for hours,call for hours,call for hours,Drive-Thru,"",35.3609531,-80.6872408,Call to confirm

UMC Health System,"It’s important to remember if you haven’t traveled to an infected region as defined by the CDC or been in close contact with someone known to have the virus, your risk of contracting COVID-19 is very low. However, the CDC recommends if you’ve traveled to an infected region within the last 14 days or were in close contact with someone confirmed to have the infection and begin to feel sick with fever, cough, or shortness of breath, seek medical care. Call your primary care provider before going to a healthcare facility and let them know about your travel and symptoms to limit potential exposure to others and avoid spreading the virus. If you don't meet the CDC's criteria for COVID-19 but are still concerned or have questions, you can speak directly with a provider through UMC Virtual Visits to receive specific care recommendations.",602 Indiana Ave,Lubbock,TX,79415,"",(806) 761-0111,https://www.umchealthsystem.com/covid-19/,"",7AM-7PM,7AM-7PM,7AM-7PM,7AM-7PM,7AM-7PM,1PM-5PM,1PM-5PM,Drive-Thru,"",33.5880703,-101.8912391,"7 am - 7 pm, Monday - Friday; 1 pm - 5 pm, Saturday - Sunday"
